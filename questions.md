* If all theories are contextual, situated, and subjective, how can it be coherent to posit a theory which says so?
* Can Heidegger's idea of tools being ready-at-hand or present-at-hand be applied to mental tools, i.e., ideas and models? If not, why not?

Their epistemic limitations, tendencies for results to diverge from goals while perceptions of those results converge to goals, their tendency to "entrench" into a settled position and modify the modification procedure so as to prevent drift, etc.
* What happens if we reintroduce some of the complexities which Marx simplified out of his argument in Capital?
  * The distinction between simple and skilled labor
  * The regional and temporal variation of socially necessary labor time and/or simple average labor

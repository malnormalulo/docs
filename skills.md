Some research (which I'm not bothering to cite, sue me) suggests engaging in "deliberate practice", a kind of self-aware mindful practice, on very specific sub-skills of the skill you want to develop. This is kind of a work breakdown structure for skills, subskills, infraskills, etc.

Areas of study don't seem to break down hierarchically very well. There's too much interrelation. I'm going to focus instead on activities.

# Learning procedure
Practice:
```
identify new problems
remove solved problems
UNTIL end of session
  IF problem area not well isolated
    decompose
    devise measurement
  ELSE IF no improvements for several iterations
    reconsider approach to task
    reconsider decomposition
    reconsider measurement
  rehearse problem area & measure
  IF proficient
    move on to next problem area
unstructured appraisal
```

Performance:
```
PERIODICALLY
  identify new problems
  remove solved problems
  FOR EACH remaining problem
    IF problem area not well isolated
      decompose
      devise measurement
    ELSE IF no improvements for several iterations
      reconsider approach to task
      reconsider decomposition
      reconsider measurement
  perform & measure
unstructured appraisal
```

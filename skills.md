Some research (which I'm not bothering to cite, sue me) suggests engaging in "deliberate practice", a kind of self-aware mindful practice, on very specific sub-skills of the skill you want to develop. This is kind of a work breakdown structure for skills, subskills, infraskills, etc.

Areas of study don't seem to break down hierarchically very well. There's too much interrelation. I'm going to focus instead on activities.
